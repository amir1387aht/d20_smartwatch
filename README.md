# üïπÔ∏è d20_smartwatch

Reverse engineering and hacking a cheap smartwatch with the FR8016HA MCU.

<b>For bitmaps: </b>You can show bitmaps using `gfx_draw_rgb_bitmap` function and for generating bitmaps you can use `https://notisrac.github.io/FileToCArray/` tool with `16bit BBBBBGGGGGGRRRRR (2byte/pixel)` color order

<b>Youtube Video: </b>You can watch the demo at this link : https://youtu.be/pE7-zYZyz54?si=ffM0lHZJqVE9Hfgv

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build

<b>Note that you need to follow steps carefully otherwise mcu will not flash.</b>

1. Connect the **GND**, **TX**, **RX** pins to a UART converter.
2. Run `sdk/FR801xH-master/tools/FR8010H_Download_Tool.exe` and set your UART converter port and baudrate
   and also set the Bin file(the button contains `DAT` text)(you can upload aa demo file that is in projects folder) after that click on connect button(top right)
3. Trigger your mcu reset pin by connecting it to vcc(you can use a simple push button to trigger it), after that make it float
4. Click the one left to the last button to upload the firmware
